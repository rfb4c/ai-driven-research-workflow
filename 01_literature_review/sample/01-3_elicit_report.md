Algorithmic news recommenders have the potential to both threaten and enhance democracy  by guiding individual news exposure, raising questions about their role in replacing traditional media gatekeeping. 
The methodology involves developing a conceptual framework based on democratic theory to assess the democratic role of news recommenders,  focusing on liberal, participatory, and deliberative theories to create a typology of recommenders. 
The key finding is that algorithmic news recommendations are neither inherently good nor bad for democracy;  their impact depends on how they are used by the media, aligning with democratic values and theories.

Abstract only
Algorithmic news recommendation systems concentrate recommendations around a few traditional news organizations, replicating traditional industry structures  rather than promoting diversity or echo chambers,  as evidenced by a study involving 168 participants using Google News. 
- Participants: Diverse set of real-world participants (N = 168)
- Task: Participants used their personal Google accounts to search Google News for news about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
- Data Collection: Participants reported the first five stories they were recommended for each candidate. 
- Users with different political leanings were recommended similar news, challenging the assumption that algorithms create echo chambers. 
- A high degree of homogeneity and concentration in news recommendations was found. 
- The most recommended five news organizations comprised 69% of all recommendations. 
- Five news organizations accounted for 49% of the total number of recommendations. 
- The news agenda on Google News replicates traditional industry structures more than disrupts them.

Algorithmic recommender systems, like Yandex.Zen, perform gatekeeping functions, potentially leading to depoliticization by disincentivizing regional and negative content.  The study uses a qualitative approach with document reviews, interviews, and content auditing. 
Combining a review of available procedural documents with interviews and auditing of the redistribution of journalistic content via Yandex.Zen. 
The platform disincentivizes regional and negative content, which may result in depoliticisation of the news agenda. 

关于How are "filter bubbles" and "selective exposure" measured in empirical studies? What is their actual impact on political polarization, social trust, and consensus building, and are there debates within academia on this topic?

A critical review of filter bubbles and a comparison with selective exposure
Peter M. Dahlgren
 
Nordicom Review, 2021, 73 citations
 
Full text
The paper critiques theoretical assumptions about filter bubbles and selective exposure,  arguing that empirical evidence does not support the thesis at the societal level.  It highlights debates within academia about the impact on political polarization and social trust. 
The methodology in Peter M. Dahlgren (2021) is a critical review that involves scrutinizing assumptions and challenging claims about filter bubbles  by presenting nine counterarguments  and comparing filter bubbles with selective exposure and human psychology. 
The key finding of Peter M. Dahlgren's 2021 paper is that the assumptions underlying the filter bubble thesis are contradicted by previous findings in selective exposure research, and the leap from technological to societal implications is unsubstantiated.  The paper challenges the filter bubble thesis by highlighting nine counterarguments and suggesting that filter bubbles are unlikely at the technological level.  It also critiques the focus on political discussions and the assumption that personalization algorithms significantly impact societal polarization, suggesting that the US may be an outlier in terms of polarization.  The paper concludes that the filter bubble thesis relies on outdated theories and presents a misleading metaphor. 
Polarization and Partisan Selective Exposure

Partisan selective exposure is strongly related to political polarization,  with evidence that it leads to polarization and vice versa.  The study uses data from the National Annenberg Election Survey and finds that selective exposure reduces political tolerance and increases polarization.  Methodological limitations are acknowledged, indicating ongoing debates within academia. 
- The methodology uses a post-electoral survey from the April 2019 General Elections in Spain to measure media consumption. 
- Data is sourced from the Spanish Sociological Studies Center (CIS). 
- Logistic regressions are used to test hypotheses. 
- Dependent variables include last vote choice (dichotomous) and probability of voting for different parties (scaled 0-10). 
- Interviews were conducted 20-35 days after the elections. 
The key finding is that partisan selective exposure is related to and leads to political polarization,  with some evidence suggesting that polarization can also lead to selective exposure.  This relationship is characterized by citizens choosing media that aligns with their ideological views,  leading to reduced political tolerance and increased polarization.

- Main finding: There is a lack of consensus in echo chamber research due to different conceptualizations and operationalizations.
- Strength of evidence: Systematic review of 112 studies. 
- Methodology: Systematic review of existing literature. 
- Debates: Different methodologies lead to varying conclusions on the impact of echo chambers and filter bubbles on political polarization and social trust. 
- The paper is a systematic review following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines.
- The methodology involved defining research questions, searching for relevant literature using specific keywords and databases, and applying explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies. 
- An inductive approach to content analysis was used,  with codes developed based on the data. 
- A narrative synthesis approach with bibliometric features was used to synthesize evidence due to the diversity of research designs. 
The key finding is that the lack of consensus in echo chamber research is due to different conceptualizations and operationalizations,  with studies using homophily and CSS methods supporting the echo chamber hypothesis, while content exposure studies and surveys reject it.  Future research should focus on cross-platform studies,  algorithmic auditing, and examining causal relationships,  with a need for unified frameworks and interdisciplinary approaches. 
Filter bubble

Internet Policy Review, 2019, 421 citations
 
Full text
There is limited empirical evidence to support the significant impact of filter bubbles and selective exposure on political polarization and social trust.  While people self-select information, they also encounter diverse perspectives.  The effects on knowledge gains are understudied.  Current evidence does not justify strong concerns about filter bubbles. 
The methodology involves a review of existing literature and policy documents to address concerns about filter bubbles and personalization.  It includes providing an overview of concerns in public policy discourse  and reviewing empirical research insights on the prevalence and effects of personalized communication. 
The key finding is that there is currently no empirical evidence to support strong concerns about filter bubbles or echo chambers, as users generally encounter a diverse media diet.  However, future advancements in personalization technology could potentially lead to problems for democracy if personalized content becomes a primary information source.
